## Introduction 

In this series of articles, we will walk through a demonstration application that is built with Microservices from the ground up. You can follow along by installing the various applications to understand how they work together.

### Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS)

Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS) is an orchestration service for the hosting Microservices applications. The following is a description of the demonstration applications hosted in AKS.

### Nodes

A node is a Virtual Machine (VM) in the cluster. Each node has the services necessary to run pods and is managed by a master component.

### Pods

A pod is a group of one or more docker containers, with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers. Pods are run in nodes.

### Cluster

The group of nodes , as a whole, is called a cluster. The following diagram illustrates our Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

### Services

The main microservices that make up the application are:

* Product Service - This is an ASP.NET Core Web API that manages product data.
* Order Service - This is an ASP.NET Core Web API that manages order data.
* Identity Service = This is an ASP.NET MVC application that provides single-sign-on and provides authorization services for the Web APIs.
* Store Front End = This is an ASP.NET Core MVC application that will serve as our store front end application.
